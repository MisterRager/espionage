SPI breakout board for the ESP8266

This is my first attempt at making a PCB layout. It's called "espionage" because it's for getting the SPI bus on the ESP8266.

I'm not particularly familiar with open-source hardware licenses, but please use anything you find useful here. Just let me know if you want to try to make money off of my work even if you don't intend to give me any of that money.
